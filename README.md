# Hangman Game

This is a simple Hangman game implemented using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The game allows players to guess a word by suggesting letters. Players have a limited number of attempts to guess the word before losing the game.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   
   cd hangman
   

3. Open the hangman.html file in your preferred web browser.

## How to Play

1. The game will display a series of dashes representing the letters of the word to be guessed.

2. Click on the virtual keyboard or use your physical keyboard to enter a letter as your guess.

3. If the letter is present in the word, it will be revealed in the corresponding position(s) in the word.

4. If the letter is not present in the word, a part of the hangman's body will be drawn.

5. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or the hangman's body is completely drawn.

6. If you guess the word correctly, you win the game. Otherwise, you lose.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the words array in the hangman.js file. Add or remove words as desired to change the pool of words from which the game randomly selects.

You can also modify the CSS styles in the hangman.css file to change the appearance of the game.
